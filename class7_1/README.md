# Algorithms: Week 7, Class 1 (Tuesday, Aug. 25)

After a quick look back at last Thursday's material, we'll spend some time looking over [examples](https://github.com/datapolitan/lede_algorithms/blob/master/class1_1/newsroom_examples.md) of algorithms and journalism from earlier in the course and talk about how to build on the skills you've learned here going forward. I'm counting on wrapping up early so we can talk about final projects.

## Resources for later

- IRE/NICAR: I've said this a hundred times, but [sign up](http://www.ire.org/membership/). Use the student rate if you'd like. And if someone there balks, tell me and I'll talk to them.
