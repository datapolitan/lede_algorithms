    ########## STEP 1: DATA IMPORT AND PREPROCESSING ##########

    # Here we're taking in the training data and splitting it into two lists: One with the text of
    # each bill title, and the second with each bill title's corresponding category. Order is important.
    # The first bill in list 1 should also be the first category in list 2.
    training = [line.strip().split('|') for line in open('data/bills_training.txt', 'r').readlines()]
    text = [t[0] for t in training if len(t) > 1]
    labels = [t[1] for t in training if len(t) > 1]

    # A little bit of cleanup for scikit-learn's benefit. Scikit-learn models wants our categories to
    # be numbers, not strings. The LabelEncoder performs this transformation.
    encoder = preprocessing.LabelEncoder()
    correct_labels = encoder.fit_transform(labels)

    ########## STEP 2: FEATURE EXTRACTION ##########

    ########## STEP 3: MODEL BUILDING ##########
    print 'Training ...'

    #model = MultinomialNB()
    model = RandomForestClassifier()
    fit_model = model.fit(data, correct_labels)

    # ########## STEP 4: EVALUATION ##########
    print 'Evaluating ...'

    # Evaluate our model with 10-fold cross-validation
    scores = cross_validation.cross_val_score(model, data, correct_labels, cv=10)
    print "Accuracy: %0.2f (+/- %0.2f)" % (scores.mean(), scores.std() * 2)

    # ########## STEP 5: APPLYING THE MODEL ##########
    # print 'Classifying ...'
