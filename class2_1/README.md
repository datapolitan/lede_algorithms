# Algorithms: Week 2, Class 1 (Tuesday, July 21)

Today we'll spend the first hour reviewing last week's material by exploring a new dataset: transportation data used by FiveThirtyEight to build their [fastest-flight tracker](http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/flights/), which launched last month.

Then we'll talk about why it's important to learn, and explain, what's going on under the hood of modern algorithms -- both as an exercise in transparency and skepticism and as a setup for Thursday's class, where we'll begin discussing regression.

In lab, you'll continue our class work by analyzing some data on your own and developing your results into story ideas. Then we'll ask you to critique a project released earlier this summer by NPR.

## Hour 1: Exploratory data analysis review

We'll be working with airline on-time performance reports from the U.S. Department of Transportation, which you can download [here](http://www.transtats.bts.gov/DL_SelectFields.asp?Table_ID=236&DB_Short_Name=On-Time). The rest of what you'll need is in the accompanying [iPython notebook](https://github.com/datapolitan/lede_algorithms/blob/master/class2_1/EDA_Review.ipynb).

## Hour 2: Transparency and the "nerd box"

First, we'll read Simon Rogers' piece in Mother Jones: [Hey Wonk Reporters, Liberate Your Data!](http://www.motherjones.com/media/2014/04/vox-538-upshot-open-data-missing) (and possibly this: [Debugging the Backlash to Data Journalism](http://towcenter.org/debugging-the-backlash-to-data-journalism/)).

Then we'll discuss the evolution of transparency in data journalism and why it's important: from the journalistic tradition of the "nerd box," through making data available via news apps, and finally to more modern examples of transparency.

## Hour 3: From transparent data to transparent algorithms

Even if you never write another algorithm before you die, this class should at least teach you enough to ask good questions about their capabilities and roles in society. We'll look at stories from some reporters who can articulate a clear, accurate understanding of how algorithms work, as well as some who ... well ... can't.

Here are a few examples from one of those categories:

  - [Experts predict robots will take over 30% of our jobs by 2025 â€” and white-collar jobs aren't immune](http://www.businessinsider.com/experts-predict-that-one-third-of-jobs-will-be-replaced-by-robots-2015-5)

## Lab

You'll be working on two things in lab today. First, by way of review, download a slice of the [data](http://www.transtats.bts.gov/DL_SelectFields.asp?Table_ID=236&DB_Short_Name=On-Time) we used for the class exercises. Explore that data on your own using the skills you've learned so far and come back with two 100-ish-word story pitches. Each pitch should also come with a brief description of how you analyzed the data in order to get that idea.

Second, write a short critique of NPR and Planet Money's recent coverage of the effect of algorithms and automation on the labor market. You don't need to listen to all of their podcasts on the subject (they did a handful), but check out [a few of them](http://www.npr.org/sections/money/2015/05/08/405270046/episode-622-humans-vs-robots), look at some of their [data visualizations](http://www.npr.org/sections/money/2015/05/21/408234543/will-your-job-be-done-by-a-machine) and play around with their tool that calculates whether your job is [likely to be done by a machine](http://www.npr.org/sections/money/2015/05/21/408234543/will-your-job-be-done-by-a-machine).
