# Algorithms: Week 3, Class 1 (Tuesday, July 28)

Today we'll be reviewing a bit of material from last week, including both your lab assignments from last Tuesday and Thursday's lesson on regression, and then expanding on the latter in a couple ways.

First we'll review, and (roughly) recreate a couple stories that have employed regression in basic ways. Then, in the interests of transparency, we'll talk a bit about what's going on under the hood with the algorithms that comprise regression.

Finally we'll touch briefly on the idea of classification using a portion of a project we're currently implementing at the Times.

## Hour 1/1.5: Review

First we'll talk through some of your story ideas and critiques from last Tuesday. Also, here's an [interesting story](http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/07/26/using-algorithms-to-determine-character/) from yesterday's Times that we'll briefly discuss as well.

Then we'll revisit some basic regression concepts from last week using [this iPython notebook](), which (very roughly) mimics a project that the St. Paul Pioneer Press did in 2006 and 2010, known as [Schools that Work](http://www.twincities.com/ci_15487174).
