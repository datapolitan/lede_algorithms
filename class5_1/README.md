# Algorithms: Week 5, Class 1 (Tuesday, Aug. 11)

We'll pick up where we left off last week with the bill classification problem, using it as an excuse to introduce a method of feature creation that is especially useful for text documents -- the idea of vectorization. If we have time, we'll also discuss the basic idea of supervised learning:

## Hour 1: Exercise review

We'll talk in detail through the exercises from last week (which were deliberately difficult) and use them to segue into basic natural language processing techniques.

## Hour 2/2.5: Vectorization

We'll talk about how to use vectorization to engineer our features for natural language classification and clustering problems, rather than building features by hand. We'll then revisit the bill classification problem from last week using what we've learned.

## Hour 2.5/3: Unsupervised learning

We'll talk a little about the intuition and dangers of unsupervised learning, also known as clustering, using crime data as our example.

## Lab

You'll be doing two things in lab today:

  - First you'll work through a simple document classification problem (classifying drug-related and non-drug-related press releases) using vectorization and the other techinques we discussed in class.

  - Second, take a look at [this map](https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/1/embed?mid=z9S6reOYqCIE.kQnlzV2-uDzg), which shows police dispatch logs for Columbia, Mo., over the first 10 days of August. Within the map, there are three layers (eps_0.3, eps_0.2, eps_0.4), each of which shows hotspots of dispatches calculated in slightly different ways. Choose what you think is the fairest representations of the hotsports and write a couple paragraphs characterizing your findings. Be sure to include the layer you chose in your Tumblr post.
