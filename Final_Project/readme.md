##Final Project


The final project is a chance for you to demonstrate the skills you've learned in this and other Lede classes to explore a topic of personal or professional interest using data. You should demonstrate not only strong technical ability, but also the ability to synthesize the data in interesting and meaningful ways. 

Requirements:
+ You must write a blog post, [submitted through the class Tumblr](http://ledealgorithms.tumblr.com/submit), outlining your project, your goals, your methodology, and your findings. Specifically address the data you used, it's source, the steps you took to clean the data, and the insights you gained at each step, either with respect to your project or working with data more generally.
+ You must present your work in class, either August 27th or August 31st. Prepare a 15 minute presentation on the points covered in your blogpost and be prepared to answer questions. <strong>All work is due September 1st.</strong>
+ You must provide the source code for your project. Code should be well written and commented wherever possible to explain the operation. 

You are free to work in groups and we encourage you to find projects that are of limited enough scope to fit into the time alotted for this project. Often we work under tight deadlines and being able to constrain scope ensures projects is important. Often a smaller, more constrained objective will allow us to better understand the important task and essential challenges. Attempting to implement all we envision at once, is a recipe for disaster (like Healthcare.gov). Take this opportunity to develop a more iterative approach and develop your project in phases rather than tackle everything all at once. For more information on this approach look into [Agile Development](http://agilemethodology.org/). 

If you work in groups, please indicate in your blog post the work of each person on the project so they may receive the proper credit. 

If you have any questions or need assistance shaping projects, please don't hesitate to reach out.
