# Algorithms: Week 6, Class 1 (Tuesday, Aug. 18)

After a quick review of the homework, we'll explore in-depth several methods for clustering crime data before we return to and expand on the document clustering problem from last Thursday.

## Hour 1: Exercise review

We'll talk in detail through the bill classification problem and the ambiguities inherent in clustering data, via the crime example we talked about briefly last Tuesday.

## Hour 2: Clustering crime

We'll look at the two methods you learned last week -- k-means clustering and k-nearest neighbors -- along with another one, known as DBSCAN, to see how different methods can produce different results when we apply them to crime data.

## Hour 3: Back to document clustering

Finally we'll return to the idea of document clustering that you started exploring last week, going more into depth on the ideas of document similarity and term frequency-inverse document frequency and showing how clustering can more quickly help us explore a new document set.
