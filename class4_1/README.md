# Algorithms: Week 4, Class 1 (Tuesday, Aug. 4)

This week's class is going to be a bit different than the last few. After a quick review of last week's material, we're going to build a supervised learning system that is meant to outline a rough automated approach to [this story](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/02/us/small-pool-of-rich-donors-dominates-election-giving.html) from Sunday's Times about wealthy donors to Super PACs affiliated with presidential candidates.

Along the way, we'll talk about:

  - How to train and apply different models, including the decision trees you've already discussed
  - How to engineer useful features for those models
  - How to evaluate the results of those models so you don't get yourself in trouble
  - The difference between statistical and rules-based solutions to problems like this

For lab, you'll be asked to take on a simpler supervised learning problem that will give you a chance to apply the lessons from class.

If you'd like to get a head start, feel free to read [this documentation](https://github.com/cjdd3b/fec-standardizer/wiki) on standardizing FEC data. We'll be taking a simpler approach, but much of the intuition will be similar.
